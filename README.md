### Hello everyone! 👋  

My name is Jonathan Chang. I just graduated 👨‍🎓 from UIUC and will join [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) as a software engineer.
- I believe technology shapes a better future and I have the responsibility to architect solutions and innovations to accelerate it.
- I believe information should be transparent and accessible. That's why I founded [timelinefyi.com](https://timelinefyi.com)
- Love traveling 🏕 and working out 🏋🏻. I am also a huge foodie! 🥘
- Feel free to reach out to me through my email 📩 !
